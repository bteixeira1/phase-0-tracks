## Git Definitions
# Hi Glenna!

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a tool that allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code. Version control is useful because it allows you to effectively edit your code and keeps it safe from mayhem.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is basically a copy of what you are currently working on. You would use one to implement changes before actually modifying your master branch.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit records the changes you have made to the repository. This is very much like the save button on a word document or such.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two branches are unable to merge with one another successfuly.
